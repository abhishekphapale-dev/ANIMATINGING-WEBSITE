# Animated Website Headers

This project showcases a collection of beautifully animated website headers, built with pure HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. It's designed to demonstrate a variety of engaging and modern UI animations that can be used to create a compelling user experience.

## ✨ Features

*   **Multiple Header Designs:** Three distinct header layouts, each with its own unique theme and content.
*   **Diverse Animations:** A wide range of CSS animations, from simple fades and slides to more complex effects like `bounce`, `swing`, `wobble`, and `jello`.
*   **Interactive Controls:** A "Replay Animations" button for each header allows users to re-trigger the animations on demand, providing an interactive way to experience the effects.
*   **Clean & Organized Code:** The project is structured with a clear separation of concerns, making it easy to understand and maintain:
    *   `index.html`: For the structure and content of the website.
    *   `css/style.css`: For all styling and animations.
    *   `js/main.js`: For the interactive "Replay Animations" functionality.
*   **Recruiter-Friendly:** This project is designed to be a clear and concise demonstration of front-end development skills, with a focus on UI/UX and clean code.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the web page.
*   **CSS3:** For styling and all animations (using `@keyframes`).
*   **JavaScript:** For the interactive "Replay Animations" button functionality.
